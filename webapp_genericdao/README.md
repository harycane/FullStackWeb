# WebAppusingGenericDao
A simple website that allows a user to register (and later login) and maintain a list of favorite web pages (or sites). Built the DAOs (using GenericDao ORM), JavaBeans and the table and implemented a simple website that exercises the DAO function. Used MySQL Database and Java Servlets.
